GAME 1

dav1e's bastion was super scuffed
    he should've done max trades so he can spam pearls
    also should've remembered gold armor

fortress searching
    went past -400

didn't get more wood in nether/overworld when he had the chance
could've gotten more cobble

dav1e's villageless didnt cost him much time, hurt him on food/wool but not much

he would've avoided the whole cave debacle if he did farmer trough style strats



GAME 2

villageless worked well for dav1e

sizzler kinda threw with ocean strats

dav1e 10 obsidian
    he probably shoulda gone for it
    maybe worth going in, checking for bastion, going back out?

    maybe worth using it for educated travel?
        you could swim up the water column, throw eye, swim back down

dav1e skipping bastion

sizzler mining obsidian

"he's not one to choke one cycles" - k4
"he's very consistent with his 6 beds, 5 beds"
"he's very booked up"
"he's done his research"

dav1e triangulation
    could do farmer trough strat in case you dug at the wrong spot

he didn't set his spawn in the portal room, pretty sure he had enough beds to do so



GAME 3

dav1e digs down right away

sizzler finds village

pretty even start

dav1e cod strats for iron pick, carpet strats

if ur going for iron pick maybe dont do flintless? dont need shield?

game 3 pretty well played, both had to wait awhile for pearl trades
